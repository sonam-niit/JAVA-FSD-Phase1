Final Assessment Project
------------------------------------
need to develop an application

commandline app(console base app)
------------------------------------------

Project Name: LockedMe.com
----------------------------------
SRS(software req. spec)
-----
1. Specification document - 

	1.1 Productâ€™s capabilities: project details 

	1.2 appearance: console based app

	1.3 user interactions: user can give inputs from command line

2. number of sprints required: what will you do in that sprints

3. create github account for project: create repository if already have github account

4. Java concepts being used in the project :
	show what all concepts used
		4.1 used encaptulation
			provide screenshot where you have used encaptulation
		4.2 exception handling
			provide screenshot for try catch blocak or throws where you have used

		etc.. add more

5. Data Structures where sorting and searching techniques are used. 
	5.1 suppose you have used array
		provide SS
	5.2  you have used binary search search algo
		provide SS


6. Generic features and three operations:  your features

	1. Retrieving the file names in an ascending order

	2. Business-level operations:

		2.1 Option to add a user specified file to the application(create file)

		2.2 Option to delete a user specified file from the application (delete file)

		2.3 Option to search a user specified file from the application (search file)

		2.4 Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to the main context

	3. Option to close the application(Syctem.close())


=========================================================================================================
Application (how to code)
	

	Code to display the welcome screen. It should display:

		Application name and the developer details 

	The details of the user interface such as options displaying the user interaction information 

	Features to accept the user input to select one of the options listed 

	The first option should return the current file names in ascending order. The root directory can be 	either empty or contain few files or folders in it

	 The second option should return the details of the user interface such as options displaying the 	following:

Add a file to the existing directory list

You can ignore the case sensitivity of the file names 

Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list

You can add the case sensitivity on the file name in order to ensure that the right file is deleted from the directory list

Return a message if FNF (File not found)

Search a user specified file from the main directory

You can add the case sensitivity on the file name to retrieve the correct file

Display the result upon successful operation

Display the result upon unsuccessful operation

Option to navigate back to the main context

There should be a third option to close the application

Implement the appropriate concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance
